or  select max(sal) from emp where sal not in (select max(sal) from emp);

Q- Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.
A- select (e1.MaxEngSalry - e2.MaxMarSalary) as salaryDiff from (select max(salary) as MaxEngSalry from db_employee where department_id=4) as e1, (select max(salary) as MaxMarSalary from db_employee where department_id=1) as e2

A- import pandas as pd 
maxENgsal = db_employee[db_employee['department_id']==1]['salary'].max()
maxMarsal = db_employee[db_employee['department_id']==4]['salary'].max()
print(abs(maxENgsal-maxMarsal))
